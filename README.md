# RESFixes
## What did I fix?
I fixed an issue that made reddit flairs hard to read in night mode. The contrast between the flair text and the flair background was too low.

## How did I fix it?
When night mode is turned on I begin to check all of the flairs on the page, then the flair text is either set to white or black depending on what would have more contrast with the background. I continue to check all of the flairs every second, but nothing will happen unless more flairs are loaded.

## How to see my fix working?
